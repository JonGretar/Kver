### Added

- Open a local PDF from the running app or launch without a document; failed opens leave the window available for another attempt.
- Open a PDF supplied on the command line in a native macOS reader with continuous scrolling, page navigation, and zoom controls.
- Render visible pages in background work with bounded bitmap memory for long documents.
- Build a local unsigned macOS app bundle with an icon; a downloadable release is still forthcoming.
